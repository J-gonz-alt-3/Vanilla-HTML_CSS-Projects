# Practice HTML CSS Projects

No Use of any front-end JavaScript libraries/frameworks in these projects.

The goal of completing these Vanilla (HTML/CSS) projects was to understand/practice the fundamentals.

Each HTML file in this repo has a corresponding .css file.

To find the corresponding .css file, simply open up the .html file and look for the link tag at the top and see what it's pointing to.

Javascript is NOT included in any of the projects in this repo.
